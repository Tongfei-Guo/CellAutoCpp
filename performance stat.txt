Commit f6ff46d: 100 iterations, run 10 times, average time 0.241s // runtime adding state take too much time?
Commit 3be72e7: 100 iterations, run 10 times, average time 0.148s
Commit 7cc931e: 100 iterations, run 10 times, average time 0.150s, because make_unique<Cell>() allocates dynamic memory contiguously if that's my only program 
running, in case of multiple program running, this could fail, and if that cause no memory locality, the performance would be 0.298s.

Commit 3a27b4a: 100 iterations, run 10 times, average time 0.078s, due to parallelism.

Commit 3be72e7: 100 iterations, run 10 times, average time 14.3s// after removing state_name string to int conversion, the speed is almost the same as below, the little overhead possibly comes from virtual dispatch ( 1 more level of indirection with cell itself, and virtual function calls, for example, call prepare_process())
